          h2 Watson Spoken Healthcare QA
          p The 
            a(href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/question-answer.html") IBM Watsonâ„¢ Question Answer (QA) service 
            | provides an API
            | that give you the power of the IBM Watson
            | cognitive computing system. With this service,
            | you can connect to Watson, pose questions in natural language, and receive responses
            | that you can use within your application.  The 
            a(href='http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html') IBM Watson Speech To Text 
            | service transcribes spoken language to text with low latency, and the 
            a(href='http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html') IBM Watson Text To Speech 
            | synthesizes natural sounding speeach from text.
          p In this sample, all three of these services have been hooked together to create a browser based system that enables the user ask questions in spoken language, Watson figures out the answer and speaks it back to the user.
          p This demo is using the IBM Watson Healtcare QA service. 
            | Ask any question about healthcare, and see what Watson has to say.
            | Need an idea? Just click the microphone button and ask  
            a(href="javascript:search('What are symptoms of Parkinsons disease?', true)") "What are symptoms of Parkinson's disease?"

            b This demo requires 
             a(href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream") getUserMedia 
             | for speech recognition and 
             a(href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio") HTML5 audio 
             | for playing sounds. Parts of this demo may
             | not work if your browser does not support these features.

          h3 Disclaimer
          p The Watson API is incredibly powerful, but this sample is using the 
            a(href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/qaapi/") sample public healthcare 
            | data set, 
            | which is only trained to answer 
            a(href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/qaapi/#corpora") specific kinds of questions
            | . Check this out to see what 
            | a properly trained Watson instance can do for you. This demo requires getUserMedia 
            | for speech recognition and HTML5 audio for playing sounds. Parts of this demo may
            | not work if your browser does not support these features.
